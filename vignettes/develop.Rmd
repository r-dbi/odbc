This vignette is intended to help developers of the R package install needed dependencies.

While the odbc package contains some documentation on how to install and configure database drivers in `vignette("setup")`, the documentation assumes that users are connecting to databases that have already been set up. In order to test package functionality, though, odbc sets up small example database deployments.

For the most part, this vignette assumes a MacOS system with aarch64 (e.g. M1 or M2) architecture. For Linux example code, see [`.github/workflows/db.yaml`](https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc/blob/main/.github/workflows/db.yaml), and for Windows, see [`.github/workflows/db-windows.yml`](https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc/blob/main/.github/workflows/db-windows.yml).

## Posit Professional Drivers

Posit employees have access to the [Posit Professional drivers](https://docs.posit.co/pro-drivers/) and the infrastructure used to build and test them in the rstudio/pro-drivers GitHub repository. The Posit Professional drivers are a set of drivers vendored from Magnitude Simba that support many of the most popular DBMS, including SQL Server, Oracle, Redshift, Databricks, Snowflake, etc. The repository they're developed in contains tooling to spin up a number of databases in docker containers to test against.

Note that Athena, Hive, Impala, MongoDB, and Oracle drivers are [not available for macOS aarch64](https://github.com/oracle/python-cx_Oracle/issues/617) (M1, M2, etc) at the time of writing.

### Drivers

The only documented installation method for these drivers on MacOS is via RStudio Desktop Pro. The Posit confluence page titled "\[INTERNAL\] Posit License Files for Employee Use" contains instructions for installing RStudio Desktop Pro. Once RStudio Pro is installed, install individual drivers as documented [here](https://docs.posit.co/ide/desktop-pro/database_drivers/install_database_drivers.html).

### Databases

Among other things, the rstudio/pro-drivers GitHub repository defines a `MAKE` tool for setting up and tearing down databases in docker containers. Ensure that you have a docker daemon running (i.e. Docker Desktop open) and, if you're on macOS aarch64, have `Settings > Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon` enabled. To start a container for a given `dbms`, run `MAKE dist=none DB=dbms up`, and **tear it down** with `MAKE dist=none DB=db down`. To see available `dbms` options, see the names of `.yml` files in the `docker-compose` directory. Find connection details for each database in `docker/shared/odbc.ini`.

DBMS-specific notes:

* `sqlserver`: Be sure to pass `uid` and `pwd` as arguments to `dbConnect()` explicitly, even though they're in the `odbc.ini` as well.

On macOS aarch64, you will see a `requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8)` warning when you start any of these containers. Feel free to ignore. :)

## PostgreSQL

On MacOS, install PostgreSQL with:

```shell
brew install postgresql@14
```

You'll also need to install and configure the PostgreSQL driver `psqlodbc`; see `vignette("setup")` to learn more.

To launch a PostgreSQL server locally, run:

```
brew services start postgresql@14
```

Next, create a database called "test" (or by whatever name is in the entry `Database` in your `odbc.ini` file):

```shell
createdb test
```

At this point, you should be able to connect to PostgreSQL through the R interface. Connect with:

```r
postgres <- dbConnect(odbc(), "PostgreSQL")
```

where `"PostgreSQL"` is replaced with whatever DSN you've configured.


## MySQL

First, installing MySQL with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install mysql@8.2
```

MariaDB drivers are compatible with MySQL and are more easily installed than MySQL drivers themselves in most cases. To install the MariaDB driver:

```shell
brew install mariadb-connector-odbc
```

Then, link the MariaDB driver with your MySQL data source name. That is, with the driver name `[MariaDB]` configuring your MariaDB install in `odbcinst.ini`, the first lines of your `odbc.ini` entry should look something like:

```ini
[MySQL]
Driver = MariaDB
```

After running `brew services start mysql` if needed, and confirming that the database is running with `brew services info mysql`, you should be able to:

```
library(odbc)
dbConnect(odbc(), "MySQL")
```

The second argument `"MySQL"` refers to the data source name configured above.

## SQL Server test setup

To run Microsoft SQL Server on **aarch64 (e.g. M1 or M2) MacOS**, you will need: 

* Docker 4.16 or higher
* MacOS 13 Ventura (or higher)

If needed, install Docker with:

```shell
brew install --cask docker
```

The Docker Desktop app provides a GUI to monitor deployed Docker containers and lives in `Docker.app > Show Package Contents > Contents > MacOS > Docker Desktop.app`.

To [install the SQL Server ODBC driver and (optional) command line tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/install-microsoft-odbc-driver-sql-server-macos?view=sql-server-ver15), use:

```shell
brew tap microsoft/mssql-release https://github.com/Microsoft/homebrew-mssql-release
brew install microsoft/mssql-release/msodbcsql18 microsoft/mssql-release/mssql-tools18
```

The `odbc.ini` entry should look something like:

```ini
[MicrosoftSQLServer]
driver = ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server
Server = 127.0.0.1
port = 1433
Encrypt = no
```

With the driver name in `odbcinst.ini` being `[ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server]`.

With docker and the needed driver installed, deploy the container with:

```shell
sudo docker run \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" \
  -e 'MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=BoopBop123!' \
  -p 1433:1433 \
   --name sql1 \
   --hostname sql1 \
   -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
```

The `--platform` tag is correct for M1; if you see `Status: Exited (1)` in Docker Desktop or a warning about incompatible architectures, navigate to `Settings > General` and ensure that `Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon` is checked.

To connect via odbc, we need to pass the UID and PWD via the connection string; configuring those arguments via `odbc.ini` is [not permitted](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42387084/sql-server-odbc-driver-linux-username). With the container deployed as above, the connection arguments would be:

```r
con <- dbConnect(
  odbc::odbc(), 
  dsn = "MicrosoftSQLServer", 
  uid = "SA", 
  pwd = "BoopBop123!"
)
```

Then do some configuration of the server to add a testuser and create the test database

To configure a server to add a testing user and create a test database:

```r
# Add a test user, but currently unused
dbExecute(con, "USE test")
dbExecute(con, "EXEC sp_configure 'contained database authentication', 1")
dbExecute(con, "RECONFIGURE")
dbExecute(con, "alter database test set containment = partial")
dbExecute(con, "CREATE USER testuser with password = 'BoopBop123!'")
dbExecute(con, "GRANT CONTROL TO testuser")
dbExecute(con, "DROP USER testuser")

# Create a test database
dbExecute(con, "CREATE DATABASE test")
```

On **Linux**, create a docker container with:

```shell
docker run -v "$(pwd)":"/opt/$(basename $(pwd))":delegated --security-opt=seccomp:unconfined --link sql1 -it rstudio/r-base:3.6.1-bionic /bin/bash
```

Then run:

```shell
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add -
#Ubuntu 18.04
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/prod.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list

apt-get update
ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install -y msodbcsql17
apt-get install -y unixodbc-dev
```

The resulting `odbc.ini` file will look something like:

```ini
[MicrosoftSQLServer]
driver = ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server
Server = sql1
port = 1433
Database = test
```

## SQLite

MacOS provides SQLite natively. With the SQLite odbc driver installed (see `vignette("setup")` if needed), run:

```
library(odbc)
dbConnect(odbc(), "SQLite")
```

The above example assumes the configured SQLite DSN is called `"SQLite"`.

## Oracle

A huge pain.

Get the DB container:

```shell
docker login

docker pull store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1
```

Start the container:

```shell
docker run -d -it --name oracle_db -P store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1
```

The `-P` is important to set up the port forwarding from the docker container.


Then, query the port and edit the ports in `tnsnames.ora`:

```shell
docker port oracle_db
```

The contents of `snsnames.ora` should look like:

```
ORCLCDB=(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=127.0.0.1)(PORT=32769))
    (CONNECT_DATA=(SERVER=DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME=ORCLCDB.localdomain)))
ORCLPDB1=(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=127.0.0.1)(PORT=32769))
    (CONNECT_DATA=(SERVER=DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME=ORCLPDB1.localdomain)))
```

Ensure that the current working directly is [set appropriately](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/how-configure-tnsnamesora-use-dedicated-server-process-datastage-connections-oracle-databases#:~:text=accessed%20via%20DataStage%3A-,The%20tnsnames.,specified%20by%20the%20TNS_ADMIN%20variable.). 

Then, to add a new user to the database:

```shell
docker exec -it oracle_db bash -c "source /home/oracle/.bashrc; sqlplus SYS/Oradoc_db1 AS SYSDBA"
```

```sql
alter session set "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=true;

create user test identified by 12345;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO TEST;
```

Finally, in R:

```r
Sys.setenv("TNS_ADMIN" = getwd())
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), "OracleODBC-19")
```

## Snowflake

To obtain a Snowflake account:

* If you're a Posit employee, reach out to James Blair.
* If you're not affiliated with Posit, sign up for a [free trial](https://signup.snowflake.com/).

Install drivers using the [instructions on the Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/odbc/odbc). For MacOS, feel free to ignore sections noting that iODBC is required.

On MacOS and Linux:

* Locate your `simba.snowflake.ini` file, likely in `opt/snowflake/`. You will need `sudo` access to edit it.
  * Change `DriverManagerEncoding` to `UTF-16`.
  * Change the uncommented `ODBCInstLib` entry to the [path of your unixODBC install](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/R-Studio-to-Snowflake-fails-with-error-Unable-to-locate-SQLGetPrivateProfileString-function).
* In the Snowflake UI, navigate to Worksheets, make a new worksheet using the blue "+" button in the top right-hand corner, and run the line `SELECT SYSTEM$ALLOWLIST()`. In the output, copy the URL corresponding to `"type":"SNOWFLAKE_DEPLOYMENT"`. This Deployment URL should look like a random string, an AWS region, and the snowflake API URL, e.g. `wmc39401.us-east-1.snowflakecomputing.com`.

The `odbc.ini` file should look like:

```ini
[Snowflake]
Driver      = Snowflake
Description =
uid         = <uid>
server      = <deployment-url>
```

The above assumes `Driver = Snowflake` is configured in `odbcinst.ini`. Then, connect by supplying the password as an argument:

```
con <- dbConnect(odbc(), dsn = "Snowflake", pwd = Sys.getenv("snowflakePass"))
```

In the above, the password has been set as `Sys.setenv(snowflakePass = "actualPass")`.

## Amazon Redshift

If you're a Posit employee, you should have access to the rstudio/warehouse GitHub repository. Follow the instructions there to get access to the internal Redshift cluster. Access to the cluster is only enabled through Posit's internal Workbench instance, where the professional drivers will already be installed.

Note that Redshift is based on a modified version of PostgreSQL.

## RODBC

We need to install the RODBC package for benchmarking in the vignette `vignette("benchmarks")`. The CRAN version of RODBC uses iODBC, so to use unixODBC we need to recompile it from source, specifying the odbc manager explicitly:

```r
install.packages("RODBC", type = "source", INSTALL_opts="--configure-args='--with-odbc-manager=odbc'")
```

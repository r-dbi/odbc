\title{ODBC Driver}
\usage{
odbc()
}
\description{
This function creates a driver for an ODBC database. Its output
is intended to be passed to \code{\link[=dbConnect]{dbConnect()}}.
}
\details{
The odbc package is one piece of the R interface to databases with support
for ODBC:

The package supports any \strong{Database Management System (DBMS)} with ODBC
support, including:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/}{SQL Server},
\item \href{https://www.oracle.com/database}{Oracle},
\item \href{https://www.mysql.com/}{MySQL},
\item \href{https://www.databricks.com/}{Databricks},
\item \href{https://www.snowflake.com/}{Snowflake}
}

and others.

Support for a given DBMS is provided by an \strong{ODBC driver}, which defines
how to interact with that DBMS using the standardized syntax of ODBC and SQL.
Drivers can be downloaded from the DBMS vendor or, if you're a Posit
customer, using the \href{https://docs.posit.co/pro-drivers/}{professional drivers}.

One of the central benefits of ODBC is its interoperability; any DBMS
with drivers available is accessible through ODBC. To manage information
about these drivers and the data sources they provide access to, our
computers use a \strong{driver manager}. Windows is bundled with a driver manager,
while MacOS and Linux require installation of one; this package supports
the \href{https://www.unixodbc.org/}{unixODBC} driver manager.

In the \strong{R interface}, the \href{https://dbi.r-dbi.org/}{DBI package} provides a
front-end while odbc implements a back-end to communicate with the driver
manager. The odbc package is built on top of the
\href{https://nanodbc.github.io/nanodbc/}{nanodbc} C++ library.

Interfacing with DBMSs using R and odbc involves three high-level steps:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Configure drivers and data sources}: the functions \code{\link[=odbcListDrivers]{odbcListDrivers()}}
and \code{\link[=odbcListDataSources]{odbcListDataSources()}} help to interface with the driver manager.
\item \strong{Connect to a database}: The \code{\link[=dbConnect]{dbConnect()}} function, called with the
first argument odbc(), connects to a database using the specified ODBC
driver to create a connection object.
\item \strong{Interface with connections}: The resulting connection object can be
passed to various functions to retrieve information on database
structure (\code{\link[=dbListTables]{dbListTables()}}), iteratively develop queries (\code{\link[=dbSendQuery]{dbSendQuery()}},
\code{\link[=dbColumnInfo]{dbColumnInfo()}}), and query data objects (\code{\link[=dbFetch]{dbFetch()}}).

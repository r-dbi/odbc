\description{
Details of Oracle methods for odbc and DBI generics.

\subsection{\code{odbcConnectionTables()}}{

Query, rather than use \code{SQLTables} ODBC API for performance reasons.
Main functional difference between the implementation of \code{SQLTables} in the
OEM driver and the query below is that the OEM implementation also looks
through the synonyms. Given the performance reports, we sacrifice the
synonym look-through for better execution time.
}

\subsection{\code{odbcConnectionColumns()}}{

Query, rather than use \code{SQLColumns} ODBC API, since we bind a \code{BIGINT} to
one of the column results and Oracle's OEM driver can't handle it.

## Current state

odbc is stable, though there are still corner cases where it could have issues with certain database backends. Mostly around text encodings, datetime and logical formats.

## Known outstanding issues

The "Developing odbc" vignette at `vignette("develop")` contains instructions on running the tests locally, which is important to make the feedback loop shorter.

The hardest part of maintaining odbc is often an issue only occurs with a specific database, and setting up the environment for that database usually takes a non-trivial amount of time.

## Future directions

- Convert from using Rcpp to using cpp11.
  This is not urgent, but basically all other r-lib/tidyverse packages have been converted.

- Look into updating the version of nanodbc to a newer version.
  This is complicated by the fact that nanodbc now requires C++14, so it can't really be a drop in unless we want to bump up odbc to require C++14.
  Alternatively look into the recent nanodbc comments and port them to the current version of odbc.
  We did this for other use cases.
